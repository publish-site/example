# Backend configuration

## Docker compose example

??? Compose
```yaml { .copy title=docker-compose.yaml }

image: ghcr.io/publish-site/backend:latest
ports:

environment:

## Instead of mounting the TLS certificates you can base64 them and do inline certificates.
#FULLCHAIN:
## NOTE: This is not the privkey certificate generated from the PKI script. TLS Certificates
## PRIVKEY:

    CLIENT_CA: # The base64 string from PKI script
    volumes:
    - /your/certificate/path/fullchain.pem:/etc/nginx/ssl/fullchain.pem:ro
    - /your/certificate/path/privkey.pem:/etc/nginx/ssl/privkey.pem:ro
    ## You can also mount the CA directly 
    #- /your/certificate/path/ca.pem:/etc/nginx/ssl/ca.pem:ro
    - changeme/web/dir/:/var/www/html # for persistence between container reboots
```
